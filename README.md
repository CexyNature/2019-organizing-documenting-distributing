Organizing, Documenting and Distributing
==========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/aspp-apac/2019-organizing-documenting-distributing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/aspp-apac/2019-organizing-documenting-distributing)

This contains the code and scripts for my lecture at the 2019 summer school in
Advanced Scientific Programming in Python - Asia Pacific at the Australian
National University in Canberra.

This repository is meant to serve as a stripped-down example of how you can
combine ``sphinx`` for generating documentation, ``pytest`` for testing, and
GitHub's Travis CI for automating both processes.

The documentation for this project is hosted
[here on GitHub pages](https://aspp-apac.github.io/2019-organizing-documenting-distributing/).

The original repository for this code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/jennirinker/code-for-the-world).

The PDF of the slides are also included in this repository.
